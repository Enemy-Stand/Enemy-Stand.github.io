It was quite difficult adjusting from Ruby to Javascript. I eventually opted to drop a cohort so I could have more time to understand the material. I am starting to understand it now, but I was so confused at first, I bought a book to read so I could try and understand it more.

Using both Ruby and Javascript for this project has been a valuable learning experience for me, even more so than past projects. I never knew there werre programs that utilized multiple languages.
