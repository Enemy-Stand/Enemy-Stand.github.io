I had a pretty rough time working on this project, but it was also fun figuring out problems and learning more about how to code. I had heard that scraping can be unreliable because web pages change all the time, so I decided to scrape from a web page listing the best-selling games from various retro video game console because I knew those lists couldn't possibly change and would like my program to remain functional.
