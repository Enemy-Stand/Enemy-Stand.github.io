 This one was pretty tough. I don't remember learning anything about devise before starting this project, so getting it up and running proved to be quite a challenge. Omniauth was also quite foreign to me, but it makes perfect sense to me now.
 
 After I was done with the authentication part, I thought it would be really easy. However, creating objects that had params for the objects they belong to was a bit of a challenge. I figured out it was becuse I had to set custom setter and getter methods for the objects my join table belongs to. 
 
 I have a lot of experience with CRUD actions, so that part was pretty easy. I didn't understand how to make full use of nested routes, but after reviewing routes and resources, it made perfect sendse. After all of this, I think I have a good understanding of ruby and ruby on rails.
